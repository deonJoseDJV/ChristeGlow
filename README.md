Plans

This is an excellent blueprint for ChristéGlow, and you're already thinking like a product designer! Let's refine your plan and suggest the best technologies and presentation methods:
Final Product Form:

1. App or Website?
Best Answer: Both – start with a Progressive Web App (PWA) using MERN stack, which you can later scale into a full native app using React Native (if needed).

Recommended Tech Stack:

Frontend:
• React.js (for web) or React Native (for mobile app)
• Tailwind CSS or ShadCN for beautiful UI with dark/light modes
• Framer Motion for animations

Backend:
• Node.js + Express.js

Database:
• MongoDB (Great for structured & flexible user/community data)

AI Integration:
• OpenAI API for Zion Chatbot
• Azure Face API for F1 and F3 (emotion/doubt detection)
• Google Cloud Vision or Firebase ML Kit for image/text-based sensing if needed

Key Features (as you laid out):

Pre-login Karmas:
• F1. Face sensors → Emotion analysis → Bible verses + quotes shown
• F2. Zion chatbot → Conversational AI with spiritual guidance

Post-login Karmas:
• F3. Doubt Sensing Camera + Zion → Use photo/scan and ML to sense confusion and explain via AI
• F4. Prayer updates, Holy Mass timings, Guidelines → Auto-synced via APIs or user submissions

Community (F5 & F6):
• Hierarchical channels like Discord:
Individual → College → Campus Ministry → State → National → International
• Twitter-like short updates, polls, spiritual tweets

Backend tool for community:
• Use Socket.io for real-time updates
• Store channel data in MongoDB with access control (JWT or Firebase Auth)

Presentation Plan (Launch Deck):

1. Why ChristéGlow?
• Centralized spiritual network for Gen Z and college youth
• Combats isolation, misinformation, lack of access to ministry resources

2. Attacks Resolved:
• No youth-friendly prayer app? → ChristéGlow solves it with gamified AI guidance
• Army of Life, basic apps = spiritless → Here: Emotion, Community, Scripture, Fun

3. How it Wins:
• Personalized spiritual mentorship (Zion AI)
• Global reach + local access
• Quick login/guest modes
• Game-like growth and rewards

Tools & APIs to Use:

Free APIs:
• OpenAI (Chatbot, Bible questions)
• Bible API (https://bible-api.com or https://scripture.api.bible/)
• Firebase Auth (for login, guest modes)
• Unsplash/Canva for graphics

Paid APIs (later):
• Azure Face API
• OpenAI premium for more advanced AI
• Firebase/Firestore if scaling rapidly

Graphics & UI:
• Use Canva, Figma, or Adobe XD for wireframes and UI design
